## This repo code is used to reproduce a bug of python3.5.

There is a bug in python3.5, which is already fixed from python3.6.
In case python3.5 is a must, we need to reproduce that bug(to make sure of it) and patch to fix.

## Python3.5 bug info
#### Issue:
https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/70908

#### Fix:
https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/34eeed42901666fce099947f93dfdfc05411f286#diff-c00d56a0c132ee4bdf79f55a4b43643cf314df1fe122c07c539e120c7ec98b5e

#### Analysis
The root cause of that bug is using raw **socket.send** to send data, which may do partial write.
There are some reasons for socket.send to only send partial data. One of those is that the socket::send (slow system call) is interrupted by signal.

Following is flow of how partial write happen for signal interruption:
1. socket.send has copied partial data into the socket sending buffer, but the buffer space is not enough for remaining data. It will
block there and wait for more buffer space released by TCP/IP stack.  ** tcp_sendmsg_locked **
2. While it's waiting, it will checking whether there is signal pending for current process. ** sk_stream_wait_memory **
3. If there is signal pengding there, it will stop waiting and to return the length of bytes already copied to socket sending buffer.


**socket.send()** is a low-level method and basically just the C/syscall method send(3) / send(2). It can send less bytes than you requested, but returns the number of bytes sent.

**socket.sendall** is a high-level Python-only method that sends the entire buffer you pass or throws an exception. It does that by calling socket.send until everything has been sent or an error occurs.


## Approaches to avoid that python3.5 partial write bug
1. Switch to use >=python3.6, which use socket.sendall instead of socket.send
2. Or, patch the python3.5 with the fix stated above.
3. Or, isolate your using of that python3.5 socket.send in a new process. which can avoid factor like signal interruption mostly.
   Please note: this is not a safe method, since we still have possibility to hit partial write for other reasons. 


## Steps to reproduce:
In following reproduce step, we will create a HTTP server by server.py, which will use socket.send to transfer file to client.
And we will use wget/curl as client(client.sh) to downloading file from that HTTP server. The downloading may fail with a high
possibility.

0) In the diretory you want to start the server.py script, please prepare a file( >1MB) used for downloading.

        $ dd if=/dev/zero of=1MBfile.txt bs=1M count=1

1) Start a HTTP server, by python3.5

        $ python3.5 ./server.py 10.237.121.80
        Got server ip: 10.237.121.80
        Create HTTP server on:
        ('10.237.121.80', 43079)

2) On another host, try to download a file (>1MB) from that HTTP server (many times in a loop).
   The client.sh will stop, when it encounter download failure.

        $ sh client.sh curl 10.237.121.80 43079 1MBfile.txt
        ...
